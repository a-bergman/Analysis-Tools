# Description & Motivation

This repository contains two .py files: one containing evaluation metrics and another containing plotting functions. 

The functions contained in both files are ones I use often enough that I decided it would be easier for me to have them saved as .py files for easy importing into Jupyter notebooks.

# Contents


**The file `graphics` contains graphs for three types of data:**

- Continuous Data:
    - Histograms

    - Heat maps
    - Residual plots


- Categorical Data:

    - ROC curves

**The file `metrics` contains functions for:**

- Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> scores


- Formatted confusion matrices


- Specificity scores.
